# Java object oriented program

The purpose of this assignment is for you to gain experience with object oriented programming in
Java: in particular, the ideas of inheritance, dynamic binding (virtual methods), overriding and
overloading methods, iterators (aka generators). It will also give you some exposure to how some
programming language features are implemented, i.e., what happens "behind the scenes" when
you execute a program. Although no language provides the exact features in this assignment, a
number of languages (e.g., Awk, Icon, LISP, CLU) do provide similar features. (In fact, you
could define a little language, using techniques from first program, that would contain features
like those in this assignment.)
